Creating a floating actor in UE4 using C++
This is an implementation of Unreal Engine official documentation for animating an Unreal's actor using C++.
The code is simple and has been divided in two different sections of .cpp and .h, which show the main executable C++ file along with its header.
For those who are new to C++, .h denotes a header that acts as a content table, whereas .cpp contains the main executables.
I have tried to add as many comments as need to clarify each step. Please contact me for questions and issues.
